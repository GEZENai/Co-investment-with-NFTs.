Co-investment with NFTs.
Creating a system that uses NFTs to invest in a good, product or service.
This system is already possible with NFTs.
When investors invest or want to convert this NFT into a liquid asset, it is necessary to create a fair, fast and sustainable system that will fully protect the rights of investors.
In this way, it is aimed to create a fair and sustainable investment and trade environment protected by code by preventing the objections of the local authority.
